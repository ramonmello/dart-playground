# Dart Playground 
Dart is a programming language created by Google, with support for web, mobile, and desktop development. It is used to develop apps for the Android operating system and the iOS operating system through the Flutter framework. Additionally, Dart can also be used to develop web applications, with support for developing Single-Page Applications (SPA).

This study repository was created with the intent of developing my skills in the Dart language and recording examples of language application for future use in my projects.
